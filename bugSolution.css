The solution involves understanding and carefully adjusting CSS specificity to ensure the intended styles are applied. Here's a revised CSS file addressing the unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is intended to override the color of paragraphs within divs */
}

.special p {
  color: purple; /*This will override the green color of paragraphs in divs when the paragraph has the class 'special'*/
}

/*This selector is more specific and will override all other styles for paragraphs inside a div with class 'special'*/
.special div p {
  color: yellow;
}
```

By carefully crafting the selectors and applying the correct levels of specificity, the expected visual result is achieved. In particular, note the adjustments made to `.special p` and `.special div p`. This addresses situations where the specificity of one rule might unintentionally override another, especially in situations involving nested selectors.
